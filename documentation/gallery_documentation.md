<h5><b>Create a Gallery</b></h5><br>
<h7>For some fellows, they have so many photos that it requires a gallery! To make a gallery, start by opening a gallery that is already included in the site. Any gallery will work. Next, copy and paste that into a new .html document and re-save it. Then, take the first photo and follow the steps to change out photos  for each photo. Save each new photo in the /gallery images folder.<i>A very easy way to make it quick is to drag and drop all of the files onto the one open photoshop image and reize them all at once. Then, you can re-save them in the gallery folder all at once!</i></h7>
<h7>1.For every photo, inspect element and find the photo you would like. For this tutorial, we use lifeline1.jpg.</h7><br>
<img src="images/imageinspectelement.png" height="250px" width="500px"><br>
<h7>2. Next, Open that image in photoshop. It will be in the /images folder.</h7><br>
<img src="images/imagepsopen.png" height="300px" width="500px"><br>
<h7>3. Next, drag and drop your new image (Downloaded from the GoogleDoc) onto the photo opened in Photoshop.</h7><br>
<img src="images/imagepsnew.png" height="300px" width="500px"><br>
<h7>4. Next, resize your image to cover the old image. Note: <b>ALWAYS</b> hold shift when you are resizing as to not lose aspect ratios.</h7><br>
<img src="images/imagepsresize.png" height="300px" width="500px"><br>
<h7>5. Next, Click OK to approve and resave as a .jpg. Note: It will try to have you rename the photo with a " copy" tag on it. Delete and save a new file. For this one, try ilumexico1.jpg.</h7><br>
<img src="images/imagepssaveas.png" height="300px" width="500px"><br>
<h7>6. Now, go back to your syntax at ilumexico.html. Command+F to and search for "lifeline1.jpg". Replace "lifeline1" with "ilumexico1". <b> Be sure to include the ".jpg" tag</b></h7><br>
<img src="images/imagesyntaxsearch.png" height="250px" width="500px"><br>
<h7>7. Refresh your page to make sure it worked!</h7>
