                                        Solar Ear manufactures, assembles, and distributes the first digital, rechargeable hearing aids and batteries. The batteries are similar in cost to disposable zinc batteries that last up to 2 to 3 years. Deaf employees assemble all products. Solar Ear is a sustainable enterprise because it creates employment along with training and education programs. Solar Ear is able to reflect new light on the skills of people with disabilities.

                                        This project will ultimately help the less advantaged children in Latin America get low cost hearing aids, which will enable those children to be mainstreamed in local schools. This project aims to give the hearing-impaired child improved access to education system. The project will also empower and educate Solar Earâ€™s employees who are deaf. These initial employees will act as role models, encouraging other unemployed hearing impaired or deaf students in their region. They will be involved in future product changes, innovations and discoveries as well as be the teachers in the next affordable hearing aid project.

                        The World Health Organization estimates that 328M adults and 32M children are hearing impaired.

                        <p class="excerpt"> Otherwise healthy children and adults with severe hearing loss are kept from going to school and work because they are considered deaf. In its more severe form, this disorder is keeping them from going to school or going to work because of the negative stigma towards the hearing impaired. Thus, the extent of hearing loss leads to poverty and hardship in the families and communities affected. Those affected suffer from the lack of educational and occupational opportunities.
