                                        Whirlwind Wheelchair International is dedicated to improving the lives of people with disabilities in the developing world, while also promoting sustainable local economic development in the process with a good wheelchair. A “good wheelchair” must be safe, durable, locally repairable, and highly useable for the rider, which means it must fit the local terrain and environment.

                                        WWI aims for every person in the world who needs a high quality wheelchair to obtain one,  leading to maximum personal independence and integration into society.  Their RoughRider wheelchair is used by 25,000 riders traveling over every terrain that only the best of wheelchairs can cross, from muddy village paths to rough pot-holed urban streets.

                                        We wanted to aid Whirlwind Wheelchair International in their product design of a  modifiable trike, by interviewing trike users in Viet Nam and the Philippines. This WWI trike will be designed in such that it can be used as a potential microbusiness. We wanted to hear about their experiences with their disability and their daily use of the trike, but specifically targeted those whom used their trike to as a microbusiness or as a means of earning income. Their narratives would help us elucidate the effectiveness of the current trike designs, and this work will support WWI in their final trike design.

                            We did not realize the level of social stigma that permeated through out the disabled community. They felt like they were not good enough for anything else but the lottery industry. Before we can design anything, we must find ways to empower these communities, and in doing so, creating opportunities in the market.
