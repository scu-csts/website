                                        Lifeline Energy is a mission driven non-profit social enterprise that provides technology solutions for off-grid learning. Education is the foundation of a nation’s future and fundamental to every individual’s self-esteem. Achieving universal access to primary education is a Millennium Development Goal, however, millions of children in developing countries do not attend school regularly or at all. The number of out-of-school girls is higher than for boys.

                                        Lifeline Energy is committed to making educational opportunities broader and more accessible for all. Despite the inroads made by computers, tablets and smart phones, radio remains the most important communication medium in Africa and in other parts of the developing world. It’s not only effective, radio makes learning cost-effective, too. Lifeline Energy has partnered with the Zambian Ministry of Education to sustain the educational system for rural children in Zambia.

                                Three Global Social Benefit Fellows spent 9 months in 2013 investigating the impact of Lifeline Energy’s Lifeplayer and how it could best support interactive radio instruction (IRI) to meet the educational needs of poor, underserved children in rural Zambia. The fellows were hosted by the Jesuit Chikuni mission, four hours south of Lusaka, and worked within their network of rural schools. This action research project research evaluated the use of Lifeline Energy's educational technologies, and evaluated and further developed Chikuni mission’s agroforestry/energy poverty education program.

                                The Fellows research accomplished three objectives in order to improve the Chikuni Parish Taonga (CPT) program. <br> The first objective was to understand the barriers to education. The Fellows conducted surveys to discover what teachers and community members thought were the biggest obstacles to keep children from going to school. Understanding the root causes of school absenteeism is the first step to fixing it. <br> The second goal was to outline and understand the training and monitoring system of both the schools and the mentors. <br> The third goal was to find the best ways to support the mentors, schools, and communities to create a positive and productive learning environment.
