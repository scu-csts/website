                            The school dropout rate for girls in rural Africa is very high compared to the rest of the world. The dropout rate in Uganda is the highest in East Africa. During their menstruation cycle, girls feel uncomfortable an dembarrassed at school due to the lack of proper feminine hygiene. They often don't continue their education which makes it more difficult for them to find jobs and succeed in the future.

                            Richard Bbaale founded Banapads in 2010 to provide feminine sanitary pads to girls in rural villages so they can continue their education, as well as provide the opportunity for women in rural villages to gain experience in entrepreneurship and sales. Banapads addresses the needs of health and education for women in Uganda and Tanzania through the creation of a low-cost sanitary pad made form banana pseduo stems, which also reduces environmental waste.
